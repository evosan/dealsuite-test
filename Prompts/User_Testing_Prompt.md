# Interactive User Testing Interface
Simple Functional screen layout with modal

## Overview
Create a clean, working layout for user testing. Focus purely on functionality 
and user experience - no technical documentation or design system references.

## Goal
Build an interface that users can actually interact with and test - buttons that work, 
search that filters, data that responds to user actions.

## Required Files

### 1. HTML File (index_main.html)
- Single clean layout page
